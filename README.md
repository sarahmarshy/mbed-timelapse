# mbed-timelapse

This application takes a photo every 10 minutes and stores the images on an SD card. The application will also save a text file log to the SD card. The application utilized the [mbed OS filesystem](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/latest/APIs/storage/filesystem/) to store the photos and log.
